# SplitRooms

A mobile-first expense sharing app built with Expo React Native and AWS infrastructure. Split bills, track balances, and settle up with friends and roommates.

## Project Overview

SplitRooms is a **brand-free**, **CAD-only** expense sharing platform designed for the Canadian market. The app focuses on core bill splitting functionality with a clean, intuitive interface.

### Current Features
- Room-based expense organization
- Multiple split modes (equal, percentage, shares, per-item)
- Automatic balance calculations and settlement suggestions
- Local chat messaging within rooms
- Receipt upload preparation
- Demo user system

### Coming Soon
- **Auth** ‚Äî Real user authentication system
- **OCR Parser** ‚Äî Automatic receipt parsing and bill creation

## Project Structure

```
/splitrooms
  /app           # Expo React Native (TypeScript)
  /infra         # AWS IaC (CDK or SAM) + seed + admin scripts
  /docs          # API contracts, data contracts, settlement algorithms

```

## Development Phases

### Phase 0 ‚Äî Monorepo Scaffolding ‚úÖ
- [x] Repository initialization
- [x] Top-level project structure
- [x] Root configuration files

### Phase 1 ‚Äî Mobile App Base (Expo)
**Lead: Member 1**

Core setup and dependencies:
```bash
cd app
npx create-expo-app@latest -t expo-template-blank-typescript
npm i zustand @react-native-async-storage/async-storage
npm i react-native-paper react-native-vector-icons
npm i expo-image-picker nativewind
```

App folder structure:
```
/app
  /assets
    directory.json     # User directory (exported from DB seed)
  /src
    /screens           # Welcome, Home, CreateRoom, RoomDetail, AddBill, SettleUp
    /components        # RoomCard, PinnedSummary, MessageList, AddBillSheet
    /state             # Zustand stores for users, rooms, bills, payments, messages
    /lib               # Business logic utilities
    /types             # TypeScript domain types
```

### Phase 2 ‚Äî Fake Auth + Persistence
**Lead: Member 1**

Simple user selection system with AsyncStorage persistence:
- Welcome screen with user dropdown from `directory.json`
- Current user state management
- Profile editing capabilities
- Demo data reset functionality

### Phase 3 ‚Äî Data Models + Utilities
**Lead: Member 3 (with team collaboration)**

Core TypeScript types and business logic:

```typescript
export type Currency = 'CAD';
export type Category = 'rent'|'groceries'|'order'|'subscription'|'utilities'|'other';

export type User = {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  email: string;
  avatarUrl?: string;
};

export type Room = {
  id: string;
  title: string;
  category: Category;
  dueDate?: string;
  recurrence?: 'monthly'|'none';
  memberIds: string[];
  createdAt: number;
  createdBy: string;
};

export type Bill = {
  id: string;
  roomId: string;
  title: string;
  amount: number;      // CAD cents
  currency: Currency;
  paidBy: string;      // user id
  date: string;        // ISO
  splitMode: 'equal'|'percent'|'shares'|'per-item';
};
```

Key utilities:
- `computeBalances(roomId)` ‚Äî Calculate net balances per user
- `suggestTransfers(balances)` ‚Äî Optimize settlement transfers
- Bankers' rounding to 2 decimal places

### Phase 5 ‚Äî Local State Management
**Lead: Member 2 with Member 1**

Zustand store implementation:
- `/src/state/rooms.ts` ‚Äî Room CRUD operations
- `/src/state/bills.ts` ‚Äî Bill and split management
- `/src/state/payments.ts` ‚Äî Payment tracking
- `/src/state/messages.ts` ‚Äî Chat and system messages

AsyncStorage persistence with hydration on app start.

### Phase 6 ‚Äî Git Workflow
**Team collaboration guidelines**

Branch naming convention:
- `feat/app-fake-auth`
- `feat/app-rooms-home`
- `feat/app-create-room`
- `feat/app-room-detail`
- `feat/app-add-bill`
- `feat/app-settle-up`
- `feat/app-receipt-upload-stub`
- `feat/app-reset-demo-data`

Small, focused PRs with demo videos/screenshots.

### Phase 7 ‚Äî Database Setup (Private)
**Lead: Member 4**

AWS infrastructure:
- DynamoDB single table design (`SharedRooms`)
- CDK or SAM infrastructure as code
- Seed script with demo data
- Directory export to `/app/assets/directory.json`

**Entity Design:**
```
User:     pk=USER#<userId>,    sk=PROFILE
Room:     pk=ROOM#<roomId>,    sk=META
Member:   pk=ROOM#<roomId>,    sk=MEMBER#<userId>
Message:  pk=ROOM#<roomId>,    sk=MSG#<ts>#<id>
Bill:     pk=ROOM#<roomId>,    sk=BILL#<billId>
Split:    pk=ROOM#<roomId>,    sk=BILL#<billId>#SPLIT#<userId>
Payment:  pk=ROOM#<roomId>,    sk=PAY#<ts>#<id>
```

Private API stubs (not consumed by app initially).

### Phase 8 ‚Äî Documentation
**Lead: Member 3**

Comprehensive documentation:
- `/docs/data-contracts.md` ‚Äî Type definitions and JSON examples
- `/docs/settlement.md` ‚Äî Balance calculation algorithms and examples
- `/docs/future.md` ‚Äî Roadmap for authentication, OCR, notifications, and realtime features
